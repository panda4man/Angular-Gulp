# Angular-Gulp
Starter template for an angular project powered by gulp.

## Installation 

Run this to install all npm modules.

```
$ npm install
```

Run this to install bower components.

```
$ gulp bower
```

With all dependencies installed we can now start up the server and the watchers.

```
$ gulp
```
 
 ## Next Steps

 Running gulp will start a live reload sever at 

 ```
 http://localhost:8081
 ```

 which will watch for changes in all CSS, HTML, and JS, automatically run all minifcation & concatenation and then reload the browser.
